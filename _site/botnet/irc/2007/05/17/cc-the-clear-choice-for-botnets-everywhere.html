  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I was working this morning and noticed that "#cc":http://wiki.creativecommons.org/IRC, our IRC channel, was particularly active.  But I couldn't figure out what they were talking about.  It didn't look like any conversation about licensing _I'd_ ever seen.  And then I realized: it was a botnet rental negotiation.  What I especially loved is the question, "you a fed?" Presumably *K_Soze* is under the false impression that if a law enforcement officer answers the question dishonestly, they're guilty of entrapment.</p>
<p>Presented for your enjoyment, the logs:</p>
<p>[09:19am] K_Soze: Evenin all<br />
[09:20am] K_Soze: I'm wondering what seller sells?<br />
[09:20am] Seller: hi K_Soze<br />
[09:20am] Seller: that depends...<br />
[09:20am] Seller: what you want to buy?<br />
[09:21am] K_Soze: Well that's always the question... but it's also a matter of whether people can supply... and people can supply the right quality and quantity?<br />
[09:21am] Seller: K_Soze: you will have to be more specific?<br />
[09:22am] K_Soze: I thought a channel called cc , talking a guy called seller was specific enough, but maybe not....<br />
[09:23am] Seller: you are not a fed are you?<br />
[09:23am] K_Soze: There's no need to get spooked... I've dealt with people on this chan before who I'm sure will vouch for me<br />
[09:24am] Seller: lets just say I like to help people out<br />
[09:24am] Seller: you got a problem - i got a solution<br />
[09:25am] K_Soze: Yeah but not everyone is looking for such a high quality solution... the cc bit is generally easy... it's other more...... "mechanical" things I'm interested in...<br />
[09:25am] Seller: hmmm<br />
[09:25am] Seller: i sell by the thousands<br />
[09:25am] Seller: top quality<br />
[09:26am] K_Soze: Thousands? Well I've spoken to people who sell by the thousands... they ask if I want one or two thousand....<br />
[09:26am] K_Soze: but that's obviously not what' i'm interested in<br />
[09:26am] Seller: you dont want a couple thousand mechanical friends?<br />
[09:26am] Seller: to help out?<br />
[09:26am] K_Soze: No, I want more than a couple...<br />
[09:26am] Seller: how much more?<br />
[09:27am] K_Soze: Well I guess it's not so much the number as the commotion such a bunch of friends could induce...<br />
[09:28am] Seller: can do pings, can do http, can do smtp<br />
[09:28am] K_Soze: Geographically dispersed?<br />
[09:28am] Seller: very very effective<br />
[09:28am] Seller: all over the place - china, russia, usa<br />
[09:29am] Seller: australia<br />
[09:29am] Seller: i can mix them up for ya<br />
[09:29am] K_Soze: Hrmmmm.....<br />
[09:29am] K_Soze: by the job or by day / week?<br />
[09:29am] Seller: you rent them per week<br />
[09:29am] Seller: web interface - very easy<br />
[09:30am] K_Soze: web? no IRC?<br />
[09:30am] Seller: yep web - very easy<br />
[09:30am] K_Soze: hrmm interesting.... would be curious to give them a run.... this collection... they attracting much attention?<br />
[09:31am] Seller: barely used so far<br />
[09:31am] nathany: uh, do you guys realize this channel is for Creative Commons license-related discussion?<br />
[09:31am] Seller: oh oops<br />
[09:31am] Seller: K_Soze: see ya later<br />
[09:31am] nathany: yeah, oops<br />
[09:31am] Seller left the chat room.<br />
[09:31am] K_Soze: cc = Creative commons? laters.<br />
[09:31am] K_Soze left the chat room. ("leaving")</p>
