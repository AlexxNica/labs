## There are a few ways to get in touch with CC Labs.

* IRC: #creativecommons-dev on Freenode. See [CC's wiki](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/IRC) for more details on other IRC channels for CC.

* Send us a bug report. Generally, filing them against the [main CC.org repo](https://github.com/creativecommons/creativecommons.org/issues) is preferred, but if there's a bug with another project, report it there. You'll know what to do.

* Join the [CC development mailing list](http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-devel). 

* Email us: webmaster at the main Creative Commons domain.

* Slack: #cc-developers on CC slack.

### Contacting Rob

* Follow me on GNU social or Twitter: @robmyers (for GNU social I'm on [quitter.se](https://quitter.se/robmyers)).

* In person. If you're in the Vancouver, BC area or anywhere I happen to be at the time let me know. I love meeting up with people.
